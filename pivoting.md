my ip 10.0.5.2 I am ssh with 10.0.1.5 and found a network 192.168.1.15 now how can I start a ping sweep scan with both ssh and proxychain

If you are SSHing from 10.0.1.5 to another host and want to perform a ping sweep scan on the 192.168.1.15 network using both SSH and Proxychains, you can follow these steps:

    Establish SSH Tunnel to 10.0.1.5:
    You mentioned you are already SSHing from 10.0.5.2 to 10.0.1.5. If not, you can establish an SSH connection from 10.0.5.2 to 10.0.1.5:

    css

ssh username@10.0.1.5

Replace username with your SSH username.

Set Up Dynamic Port Forwarding:
While connected to 10.0.1.5, you can set up dynamic port forwarding. This will create a SOCKS proxy on 10.0.5.2 that you can use with Proxychains:

css

ssh -D 1080 username@10.0.1.5

This command will create the dynamic proxy on port 1080 of your local machine (10.0.5.2).

Configure Proxychains:
On 10.0.5.2, make sure you have Proxychains installed. Edit the proxychains.conf file, typically located at /etc/proxychains.conf, and ensure it's set to use the dynamic proxy on port 1080:

yaml

socks4 127.0.0.1 1080

Perform Ping Sweep:
Now, you can use Proxychains to perform a ping sweep on the 192.168.1.15 network:

r

    proxychains ping -c 4 192.168.1.15

    This command will send four ICMP echo request packets to each host in the 192.168.1.15 network using the SOCKS proxy created through the SSH tunnel.

By following these steps, you'll route your ping sweep scan traffic through the SSH tunnel established between 10.0.5.2 and 10.0.1.5 and then use Proxychains to anonymize the traffic, ensuring that the ping sweep is performed from the perspective of 10.0.1.5.

Here's how you can perform a ping sweep using both local and remote port forwarding:

Using Local Port Forwarding:

    Local Port Forwarding from 10.0.1.5:
    On 10.0.1.5, establish local port forwarding from a local port (e.g., 1080) to the target network's subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24). This will forward traffic from your machine to the remote network.

    graphql

ssh -L 1080:192.168.1.1:22 username@10.0.5.2

Replace username and 192.168.1.1 with the appropriate values for your network.

Perform Ping Sweep:
On 10.0.1.5, you can now use a ping sweep tool (e.g., fping, nmap, or a simple shell script) to scan the target network, and the traffic will be forwarded through the SSH tunnel you established.

css

    fping -g 192.168.1.0/24 -e -q -r 1

    Adjust the command and options as needed based on your preferences and tools available.

Using Remote Port Forwarding:

    Remote Port Forwarding from 10.0.5.2:
    On 10.0.5.2, establish remote port forwarding from the SSH server (10.0.1.5) to your local machine (10.0.5.2) for a specific port (e.g., 2222).

    ruby

ssh -R 2222:localhost:22 username@10.0.1.5

This will allow traffic from 10.0.1.5 on port 2222 to be forwarded to your local SSH server.

Perform Ping Sweep:
On 10.0.5.2, you can now initiate the ping sweep using a tool like fping or nmap, specifying the SSH server (10.0.1.5) and port 2222 for the target IP and port.

css

    fping -g 192.168.1.0/24 -e -q -r 1 -H 10.0.1.5 -p 2222

    Again, adjust the command and options based on your specific requirements and toolset.

Using remote port forwarding in this way allows you to forward traffic from the remote SSH server back to your local machine for further processing. Be sure to adapt the commands as needed for your particular network and toolset.
