To separate the names and surnames from the given CSV data and save them in two different files using AWK, you can use the following AWK script:

bash

awk -F',' 'NR>1 {print $1 > "names.txt"; print $2 > "surnames.txt"}' data.csv

Let's break down the AWK script:

    -F',': This sets the field separator to a comma, indicating that the data is comma-separated.
    NR>1: This condition ensures that we skip the header line in the CSV file (name,surname).
    {print $1 > "names.txt"; print $2 > "surnames.txt"}: For each line of input data (excluding the header), it prints the first field (name) to "names.txt" and the second field (surname) to "surnames.txt".

Assuming you have the data in "data.csv" as you provided:

name,surname
tom,hood
jill,hac
fud,gill

After running the AWK command, it will create two files, "names.txt" and "surnames.txt", with the following contents:

"names.txt":

tom
jill
fud

"surnames.txt":

hood
hac
gill

Each file will contain the respective names and surnames extracted from the original CSV data.

To handle the provided CSV data with an additional numeric column, you can modify the AWK script slightly to skip the header and process the name and surname fields correctly. Here's the updated AWK script:

bash

awk -F',' 'NR>1 {print $2 > "names.txt"; print $3 > "surnames.txt"}' data.csv

Given the CSV data:

name,surname
1,tom,hood
2,jill,hac
3,fud,gill

After running the updated AWK command, it will create two files, "names.txt" and "surnames.txt," with the following contents:

"names.txt":

tom
jill
fud

"surnames.txt":

hood
hac
gill

The AWK script skips the first line (header) with NR>1 and then processes the second and third fields ($2 and $3) as the name and surname, respectively, and saves them in separate files as desired.

what is data.csv here
ChatGPT

Apologies for the confusion. In the provided AWK script, "data.csv" refers to the input CSV file from which we want to extract the names and surnames.

To make the command more clear, you should replace "data.csv" with the actual file name that contains your CSV data. For example, if your CSV data is stored in a file named "people.csv," the AWK command should be:

bash

awk -F',' 'NR>1 {print $2 > "names.txt"; print $3 > "surnames.txt"}' people.csv

Remember to replace "people.csv" with the correct filename of your CSV data file in the command. This way, the AWK script will process the correct CSV file and extract the names and surnames into separate files, "names.txt" and "surnames.txt."
