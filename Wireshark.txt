   Display filters:
        IP address filter: ip.addr == 192.168.0.1
        Source or destination IP filter: ip.src == 192.168.0.1 or ip.dst == 192.168.0.1
        Protocol filter: tcp or udp or http
        Port filter: tcp.port == 80 or udp.port == 53
        MAC address filter: eth.addr == 00:11:22:33:44:55

    Capture filters (used when starting a new capture):
        IP address filter: host 192.168.0.1
        Port filter: port 80
        Network filter: net 192.168.0.0/24

    Logical operators:
        AND operator: ip.addr == 192.168.0.1 and tcp.port == 80
        OR operator: ip.addr == 192.168.0.1 or ip.addr == 192.168.0.2
        NOT operator: not ip.addr == 192.168.0.1

    Protocol-specific filters:
        HTTP filter: http
        DNS filter: dns
        FTP filter: ftp

    Display filter modifiers:
        Apply filter to specific protocol layer: ip.addr == 192.168.0.1 && http
        Limit the number of displayed packets: tcp.flags.syn == 1[0:5]
